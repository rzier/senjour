# Client for Sensor2OSC 

Theres an interesting app that i have found on F-Droid called Sensor2OSC, it streams data over UDP.
Of various sensors in an android device.

Here an Client script i have made for it although with some certain issues it works
I definately come back to this when i get time, as this can be a backbone for various projects.
